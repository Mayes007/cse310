# Overview

As a Computer Science student, I am developing foundational programming skills that will help me build more advanced applications in the future. This project is a simple starting point to practice writing and running Python code.

This software is a basic "Hello World" program written in Python. It prints a greeting message to the console and introduces me by name.

The purpose of this program is to demonstrate the ability to write and execute a Python script using a development environment, serving as a first step into Python programming.

# Development Environment

- Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
- Git and GitHub (for version control)

I used the Python programming language to build and run this project.
